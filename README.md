# <p align="center">Task Three </p>

In this task, you'll be adding images and link to your webpage. Images and links are very importand to a webpage, as they help the user interact more and tend to keep their attention.

### Your Task
- Using `<img>` tag, add an image to a webpage. It could be the image of you, a cat, a historic building, what ever you want.
- Using `<a href="">` tag and attribute, add a link to a website, that gives more information about the image you added above.

For example, if you added an image of a cat, you can add a link to a website that tells us some fun facts about cats.
- Learn about paragraphs and use them to print out the name of your school

There's no limit to the images and links you can add, just be creative.
